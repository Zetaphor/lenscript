# Lenscript

Lenscript is a scripting language inspired by the natural language state-machine based scripting system from Anyland.

## Why is it called Lenscript?

Anyland was developed by Philipp Lenssen so the name is an homage to him for the original concepts of the Anyland scripting language. Also it abbreviates nicely to LS.

## Demo

## Documentation

~~See [the wiki](https://github.com/Zetaphor/lenscript/wiki) for more information.~~

This needs to be completely rewritten. That will be done after I finish the browser implementation
